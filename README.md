# d-ary-heap-analysis
This project compares d-ary heap sorting algorithms for different values of d, implementing efficient heap operations like extrax max, insert, and increase-key. It involves generating random number sequences, performing HEAPSORT for d=2,3,4,5, and counting comparisons and swaps. The results will identify the optimal d values for efficiency.
